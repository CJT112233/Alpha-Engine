Feedback to Replit: UPIF accuracy + predictability gaps
Context
I’m testing the Scenario intake flow that:
1.	extracts parameters from free-form text, and
2.	generates a Unified Project Intake Form (UPIF) from those parameters.
What worked (Parameter extraction)
From my text input, the extracted parameters were mostly correct but incomplete
What didn’t work (UPIF generation correctness)
The UPIF had major issues:
•	Mismatch between extracted parameters and UPIF fields
Information present in extracted parameters (feedstock volume/specs, digestate routing) did not consistently appear in the UPIF.
•	Feedstock specifications not generated
The biggest gap: when I say “potato waste,” the UPIF should populate the key estimated feedstock properties needed for basis-of-design (e.g., VS/TS, TS%, C:N, etc.). Instead, it largely repeated what I typed and did not create the details.
Expected behavior
1.	Deterministic mapping: Every extracted parameter should map to a specific UPIF section/field with consistent naming and placement.
2.	Feedstock details: Given a feedstock type + volume, automatically generate a complete set of feedstock design parameters (with provenance/assumptions), then present them for user review and confirmation. 
Recommendations to make it more robust + predictable
1) Enforce a strict “single source of truth” handoff
•	The extracted parameters must guide the UPIF. If it appears as an extracted parameter, it should also appear in the UPIF
2) Separate “extraction” vs “inference/enrichment”
Right now it feels like extraction is decent, but inference is missing or inconsistent.
•	Step A: Extract what user said (verbatim facts)
•	Step B: Enrich with estimates (feedstock properties) using a consistent library/table + clear assumptions
•	Step C: Generate UPIF
5) Feedstock property defaults (the core need)
For “potato waste,” the UPIF should produce a complete “Feedstock Specs” block, including:
•	TS%, VS/TS, C:N, and any other standard parameters your model requires
•	a label like “Estimated (default)” vs “User-provided”
•	a source field (e.g., a weblink or two that sources where the extracted parameter came from)
Minimum Feedstock Parameters (Required)
These should be populated either from user input OR inferred from feedstock type defaults.
1. Identity & Flow
•	Feedstock name / category
(e.g., Potato waste, Food waste, Dairy manure)
•	Annual quantity
(TPY or wet tons/year)
•	Delivery form
(solid, slurry, liquid, mixed)
•	Receiving condition
(raw, pre-processed, packaged, depackaged)

2. Physical Characteristics
•	Total Solids (TS, % wet basis)
•	Volatile Solids (VS, % of TS)
•	VS/TS
•	Moisture content (% or derived from TS)
•	Bulk density (as received) expressed as lb/ton or lb/gal

3. Organic & Biochemical Properties
•	C:N ratio
•	Biodegradable fraction of VS (%) (or assumed AD degradability class)
•	Methane potential (BMP, m³ CH₄ / kg VS) (or inferred yield factor)

4. Contaminants & Inerts
•	Inert/contaminant fraction (% by mass)
(plastics, grit, packaging remnants)
•	Expected preprocessing requirement
(screening, depackaging, grinding)

6. Data Provenance (Critical)
For every inferred value, include:
•	Source 
(provide some logic for how generated)
•	Confidence level
(High / Medium / Low)

Extended Feedstock Parameters (Nice-to-Have)
These can be extracted or inferred if available, but are not required to generate a viable UPIF.
