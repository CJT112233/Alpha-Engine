Project Alpha (or “the engine”) is the first foundational component of Burnham’s long-term vision to internalize a world-class AI-enabled project development process from idea to steel in the ground (“The Project Factory”). Alpha is designed to take unstructured text inputs and supporting documents, identify and extract the standardized attributes that define a project, and consolidate those elements into a single, unified project input form.
Scenario-Based Source of Truth
All authoritative information exists at the Scenario level.
•	For each Project, Users may create multiple independent Scenarios
•	Each Scenario maintains its own inputs, outputs and other constraints
•	Truth is established only when explicitly confirmed by the User
•	Scenarios are independent but may inherit inputs, assumptions, and outputs from prior Scenarios, with differences tracked explicitly
Scenario Truth Record
For each Scenario, the system maintains a structured record containing:
•	Declared inputs (e.g., feedstock specifications, capacity, location)
•	Engine generated Outputs, subject to User review, modification and confirmation
•	Other explicit constraints declared by User
Declared Inputs
•	Require explicit declaration of mandatory inputs:
o	Feedstock Input: User will be required to select the Feedstock Input. This will be a two step process. 
	Step 1: The user can write or speak the Feedstock and / or uploaded documents. It will Not be a defined form to fill out. 
	Alpha will be able to extract relevant information from uploaded documents and predict parameters that are not explicitly given.
	For example, if a User says “100,000 tons of potato waste”, Alpha will estimate all necessary parameters (i.e., VS/TS, BOD, TS%, C:N, etc.)
	Step 2: All necessary parameters generated will be explicitly presented to User. User can modify and must confirm before finalizing. 
o	Output Requirements:
	User will be required to enter text or documents to define Project Output (i.e., “solids will be land applied”, “liquids sent to Moses Lake WWTP” OR must hit Dept of Ecology discharge limits in this Permit / Engineering Report AND make RNG). 
o	Location:  User will enter a location – Example: “Quincy, Washington”. This will inform cost estimates, code requirements, etc.
o	Pricing: User will input estimates of value for project inputs and outputs
o	Constraints / Assumptions: There will be a field where user can add specific documents or constraints (e.g., must use PlanET digester, using Prodeval equipment purchased for $X, must be painted red) to inform the work. 
•	Preliminary Output:  Unified Project Intake Form (“UPIF”) which takes all of the above and displays it in a standardized format. User can review / edit and must confirm the UPIF before running the remainder of the program.  
Below I highlight Four Key Features Necessary to build the above:
1.	Coversational Input Capture
2.	Document Upload & Processing
3.	Intelligent Parameter Extraction
4.	UPIF Review & Confirmation

CONVERSATIONAL INPUT CAPTURE
Overview
Conversational Input Capture enables users to provide project information in a natural, flexible way rather than through rigid forms. Users type project details—feedstock specifications, output requirements, location, pricing, and constraints—in whatever format and order they prefer. The system accepts free-form text input where users can describe their project conversationally, providing as much or as little detail as they have available.
This feature solves the problem of forcing users into predefined input structures before they fully understand what information is needed. By accepting natural language input, it reduces friction at the start of the project evaluation process and allows users to quickly capture their initial project concept. The conversational input serves as the raw material for the Intelligent Parameter Extraction & Prediction feature, which will structure and complete the information.
Terminology
•	Scenario: A single project evaluation with its own set of inputs, assumptions, and outputs. Users create scenarios to explore different project configurations.
•	Feedstock: The input material for the project (e.g., potato waste, dairy manure). Feedstock specifications include volume/capacity and technical parameters.
•	Output Requirements: What the project will produce or how it will handle processed materials (e.g., "solids land applied," "RNG production," "discharge to WWTP").
•	Constraints/Assumptions: Specific requirements or conditions that must be incorporated into the project design (e.g., "must use PlanET digester," "equipment purchased for $X").

Feature Behavior & Rules
Input Processing Flow
The conversational input feature operates as the first step in a two-stage process. Users provide information freely in this stage, and the system captures everything without validation or prompting. After users have entered their initial information and uploaded any supporting documents, the Intelligent Parameter Extraction & Prediction feature processes all inputs together to identify what information is present, what is missing, and what can be predicted.
This separation means the conversational input interface does not need to validate completeness, prompt for missing information, or enforce required fields. Its sole responsibility is to accept and preserve user input in whatever form it arrives.
No Voice Input in Phase 1
The initial release supports text input only. Voice input capability is deferred to a future phase. The interface and data model should not preclude adding voice input later, but no voice capture or transcription functionality is required for Phase 1.
Input Persistence
All text entries are preserved exactly as entered and associated with the scenario. This creates an audit trail of what the user originally provided and ensures that no information is lost during the extraction and prediction process.
Relationship to Document Upload
Conversational text input and document upload are complementary input methods. Users may provide information through text, documents, or both. The conversational input feature focuses on text entry; document upload is handled by a separate feature. Both types of input are processed together by the Intelligent Parameter Extraction & Prediction feature.

DOCUMENT UPLOAD AND PROCESSING

Overview
Document Upload & Processing enables users to provide project information by uploading existing documents rather than manually retyping information. Users can upload engineering reports, permits, specifications, lab test results, and other relevant documents that contain project details. The system accepts these documents, extracts text content (including from images and scanned PDFs using OCR), and makes the content available for the Intelligent Parameter Extraction & Prediction feature to process.
This feature solves the problem of users having valuable project information locked in existing documents. Rather than forcing users to read through documents and manually transcribe relevant details, the system can directly process document content alongside conversational text input. This reduces data entry effort and ensures that detailed technical information from formal documents is captured accurately.
Terminology
•	Document: Any file uploaded by a user containing project-related information. Documents may include engineering reports, permits, specifications, lab test results, vendor quotes, or other relevant materials.
•	OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Technology that extracts text from images and scanned documents, enabling the system to process content from non-text-based files.
•	Text Extraction: The process of retrieving readable text content from uploaded documents, whether from native text formats or through OCR.

Feature Behavior & Rules
This section clarifies how the requirements behave in practice and how they interact. It explains cross-requirement interactions, defaults, constraints, and edge conditions without prescribing UI or user flows.

INTELLIGENT PARAMETER EXTRACTION
Overview
Intelligent Parameter Extraction & Prediction analyzes user-provided information—from conversational input, uploaded documents, and direct data entry—to automatically populate UPIF parameters. The feature uses AI to identify relevant project details within unstructured content, map those details to specific UPIF fields, and predict values for parameters not explicitly stated. This eliminates the tedious manual process of filling out lengthy forms field-by-field. Users provide information in whatever format is most convenient, and the system translates that information into a structured UPIF, dramatically reducing scenario setup time and cognitive load.
Terminology
•	Parameter Extraction: The process of identifying specific UPIF field values within unstructured user input (text, documents, conversation).
•	Parameter Prediction: The process of inferring likely values for UPIF fields not explicitly mentioned by the user, based on context and related information.
•	UPIF (Unified Project Information Form): The structured data model containing all parameters needed to define a scenario.
•	Confidence Score: A measure of how certain the system is that an extracted or predicted parameter value is correct.

•	AC-IPEP-002.2: When a parameter value is stated explicitly (e.g., "the project site is 5 acres"), the system shall extract the value with high confidence.
•	AC-IPEP-002.3: When a parameter value is stated implicitly or requires interpretation (e.g., "a small residential lot"), the system shall extract a reasonable value based on context.
•	AC-IPEP-002.4: When multiple values for the same parameter are found across different sources, the system shall resolve conflicts by prioritizing the most recent or most specific information.
REQ-IPEP-003: Parameter Prediction

Acceptance Criteria:
•	AC-IPEP-003.1: When a UPIF parameter has not been explicitly mentioned by the user, the system shall predict a value based on related parameters and context.
•	AC-IPEP-003.2: When predicting parameter values, the system shall use domain knowledge and typical relationships between parameters (e.g., predicting soil type based on geographic location).

•	AC-IPEP-005.1: When parameter extraction and prediction are complete, the system shall populate the UPIF with all extracted and predicted values.
•	AC-IPEP-005.2: When populating the UPIF, the system shall preserve any values the user has manually entered, giving user input priority over automated extraction.

Acceptance Criteria:
•	AC-IPEP-006.1: When a user adds new conversational input to a scenario, the system shall re-analyze all available information and update extracted and predicted parameters.
•	AC-IPEP-006.2: When a user uploads additional documents to a scenario, the system shall re-analyze all available information and update extracted and predicted parameters.
•	AC-IPEP-006.3: When re-analyzing, the system shall not overwrite parameters the user has manually reviewed and confirmed.
•	AC-IPEP-006.4: When re-analyzing results in new or changed parameter values, the system shall notify the user that updates are available for review.
Feature Behavior & Rules
Analysis Triggers: Parameter extraction and prediction occur automatically whenever new information becomes available. When a user submits conversational input, uploads a document that completes text extraction, or manually enters a parameter value, the system triggers re-analysis. This ensures the UPIF reflects the most current and complete information without requiring the user to explicitly request updates.
Conflict Resolution: When multiple sources provide different values for the same parameter, the system applies a priority hierarchy: user-confirmed values (highest priority), explicitly stated values from the most recent input, explicitly stated values from earlier input, and predicted values (lowest priority). If two explicit statements conflict and neither has been user-confirmed, the system uses the more recent statement and flags the conflict for user review.
Prediction Strategy: The system predicts parameter values using multiple strategies: inferring from related parameters (e.g., predicting construction timeline based on project scope), applying domain defaults (e.g., standard setback requirements for a given jurisdiction), and using statistical patterns from similar scenarios. Predictions are always labeled as such and never treated as confirmed facts. The system prioritizes conservative predictions that are likely to be safe or typical rather than optimistic predictions that might be incorrect.
Confidence Thresholds: Confidence scores range from 0 to 1. Extracted values explicitly stated in user input typically score 0.8 or higher. Predictions based on strong contextual clues score 0.5 to 0.8. Speculative predictions based on weak signals score below 0.5. The system populates parameters regardless of confidence level but uses confidence to determine how prominently to flag values for user review.
Incremental Refinement: As users provide more information over time, parameter values become more accurate and confidence scores increase. A parameter might start as a low-confidence prediction, then be refined to a medium-confidence extraction when a document mentions it indirectly, and finally become a high-confidence extraction when the user explicitly confirms it. The system maintains this progression transparently, allowing users to see how parameter certainty evolves.
Preservation of User Intent: Once a user has reviewed and confirmed a parameter value—either by explicitly approving it or by manually editing it—the system treats that value as locked. Subsequent re-analysis will not overwrite user-confirmed values, even if new information suggests a different value. This prevents the system from undoing user decisions. However, if new information strongly conflicts with a confirmed value, the system may flag the conflict for user attention without automatically changing the value.
Empty Parameters: Not all UPIF parameters will have extracted or predicted values. If the system finds no relevant information for a parameter and cannot make a reasonable prediction, the parameter remains empty. This is preferable to populating every field with low-confidence guesses. Users can fill empty parameters manually or provide additional information to enable extraction or prediction.
UPIF Review & Confirmation
Overview
UPIF Review & Confirmation provides users with a structured interface to review, validate, and edit the automatically populated UPIF before finalizing their scenario. After the system extracts and predicts parameter values, users need to verify accuracy, correct errors, and fill any remaining gaps. This feature presents the UPIF in a reviewable format, highlights parameters that need attention (low confidence, conflicts, empty fields), and allows users to make corrections efficiently. By guiding users through a focused review process rather than requiring them to validate every field, the feature ensures scenario accuracy while minimizing review time.
Terminology
•	Confirmation: The act of a user explicitly approving a parameter value, indicating they have reviewed it and believe it to be correct.
•	Flagged Parameter: A parameter that requires user attention due to low confidence, conflicts, missing value, or validation errors.
•	Validation: Automated checks that verify parameter values meet format, range, and logical consistency requirements.
•	Scenario Finalization: The process of completing UPIF review and locking the scenario configuration for downstream use.
